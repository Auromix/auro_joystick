# üéÆ Auro Joystick

Auro Joystick is a Python library designed for interfacing with joystick devices in robotics applications, offering robust support for ROS to facilitate easy integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Joystick Detection:** Automatically identifies supported joystick devices.
- **Event Handling:** Efficiently processes input events for joystick buttons and axes.
- **ROS Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both ROS1 and ROS2 for robotic systems.
- **Configurable Logging:** Delivers comprehensive logging for straightforward debugging.
- **Custom Event Handlers:** Supports the registration of custom event handlers for specific joystick actions.

## üß™ Testing Conditions

Auro Joystick has been tested on the `Beitong` gamepad.

It is also compatible with other controllers that follow the `Xbox` layout.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install Auro Joystick, you can use one of the following methods:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install auro_joystick
```

```bash
# Install from the current directory (local development)
pip install .
```

## üî• Quickstart

You can find detailed examples for the project in the `examples` directory of the repository.

### Print Input

This example will display the current inputs and corresponding values from your gamepad:

```bash
python examples/print_input.py
```

### ROS Example

Use the `left joystick` to control the movement of a turtle in Turtlesim, while the `right joystick` will manage its rotation.

Press the `B` key to reset the turtle.

```bash
# [Terminal 1]
# Run roscore
roscore
```

```bash
# [Terminal 2]
# Run Turtlesim
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

```bash
# [Terminal 3]
# Run the example
python examples/control_ros_turtlesim.py
```
